                                        <p>Although it is viewed as not being agile, a majority of our communication as a team was conducted on a Facebook
                                            group chat that we created. This was so we could remain in contact at all times and be aware of what
                                            each team member is doing at the time (i.e. what task, who has completed what, etc). Further more, we have had scheduled
                                            meetings on Thursdays as to finish up any tasks or tidy up  rouge content before we complete a Sprint. 
                                            I have found this method of communication and time management to be very effective in terms of motivation and 
                                            workload-mitigation when it comes to contributing to the project.</p>
                                            
                                            <p>However, this has also caused some miscommunication between team members, as I have found myself to increasingly
                                                rely more on using the Facebook chat as a means to communicate rather than attend the scrums more frequently.
                                                This has also affected how frequent our scrums have been, although this is more to do with dealing with 
                                                responsabilities and commitments that we had outside of the project rather than the use of the Facebook chat. In addition, we also did not communicate well
                                                 with the client thus neagtively affected our project's quality in certain areas. 
                                                </p>

                                                <p>I found that the best way to reprehend this behaviour within our team, is to notifiy my colleagues as soon as possible
                                                        about attending certain responabilities that would otherwise hinder my attendence to the scrum meetings. Furthermore, 
                                                        I would have to frequently check on our github to view any changes that have been made, or issues that have been created or altered. 
                                                        In addition, our team could have created a set schedule for regular scrum meetings, therefore there would be a better understanding
                                                    of when we would have a scrum rather than trying to organise one on the day. This could not be made more clear than for us to reflect on the agile principle
                                                 6. <blockquote cite="https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/">
                                                    6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
                                                </blockquote> </p>

                                                <p> 
                                                    I have learned that communication, no matter how small or trivial, makes up the basis of a good functioning agile team and should not be taken so lightly.
                                                    Furthermore, it is important to have good organisation skills in order to get important team members who need to be present to attend certain scrum meetings,
                                                     as although communication technology is efficient and easy to access, face-to-face communication is more reliable as each individual can see what their team member is feeling about 
                                                     a certain issue or task and can take immediate action right then and there to fix it. I wish to take this on board and improve upon my own communication within a work based environment in the future, 
                                                     such as maintaining a high level of attendence to all meetings, and contacting the team immediatly to discuss any issues or errors so they can be resolved on the day rather than later on in the week.
                                                </p>
                                                <br>

                                        <h3><span class = "blue">Leadership</span></h3>
                                        <p>When it came to proving some form of leadership to the team, I found that I did not really provide any as I seemed to have simply listened and took on tasks rather than voice my opinion 
                                            of the project or issue out a task. However, I have learned quite a lot about what leadership intails in an agile driven enironment, and as such now know to take on a more assertive and active role within a project team. 
                                            It is not to say that I didn't show any leadership qualities, as I did manage to take on board criticial feedback from team members and used it to improve upon certain tasks, such as editing the code around the semester countdown clock as the functionality and code eligance did not meet a professional criteria. I believe 
                                        that the agile principle 9. applied the most to this situation. <blockquote cite="https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/">
                                            9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
                                            </blockquote></p>

                                            <p>Furthermore, I recognize that an agile leader needs to encourage a healthy mindset from their team members, as well as their selfs. 
                                                This applied a lot to myself, as over the semester I had been going through a great deal of stress and anxiety outside
                                                of the work place, and as such had voiced my concern with the team and sought help to resolve this. Further down the track, I had also caught the flu which 
                                                caused the other team members to take up on of my given tasks. Due to these circumstances, I believe our team, as much as myself, took the appropriate approach
                                                to this as we all recognized that I could not be of help if my well being, both physical and emotional, was at risk. In addition, we also knew that no matter the circumstances
                                                we had to have a completed functioning software, hense why my work load of that week was cut in half so I could still produce something from home that did not require
                                                too much demand to complete. I carried out this course of action based on the agile principle <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/">5</a>, which mentions that projects should 
                                            be built around motivated individuals and to give them a healthy environment and the support they need. Furthermore, this process also alludes to
                                        the agile leadership concept shown below, of which I believed to be an essential ideaology to use within our project team.

                                                Overall, the knowledge I have taken from this has allowed me to learn what it means to take on a leadership role in 
                                                an agile team. I have learned that being a leader intails high quality thinking in which they engage with 
                                                their individuals to help resolve an issue through critical thinking and high quality time management. A good agile leader also 
                                                recognizes which tasks has the highest priority that requires more attention, thus giving them that ability to divert their time working 
                                                on one task to assisest others who maybe working on high value tasks. They also strive themselves to live up to such virtues as being humble,
                                                 empathetic and share compassion towards their team members, however, they must be able to work on themselves before working on others. Finally, a good agile leader
                                                  needs to be able to take on critical feedback from their colleagues and utilize that feedback to better improve the overall task and project, no matter how negative that feedback may seem.
                                                   Although I did not show all of these characteristics within our team, I wish to take on board this lesson and utilize it with any further project I may work on in future, as well as take up a much more 
                                                   active leadership role to benefit others around me as well as myself. This way, my ideas and opinions will be voiced more often, and I will improve my adaptability when in comes to sudden changes to the workflow 
                                                   or the project in general.

                                        <p>As a project team, we understood overtime who worked well in certain areas and who found certain roadblocks
                                            to either unfamiliar technology or programming languages. Essentially, when it came down to that we would offer up assistence to enable the 
                                            struggling individual to better perform their task that may involve such technology they have never used before. This was more apparent when we were
                                            introduced to the website framework known as Laravel, in which none of us knew anything about. So when it came time to shift over the skeleton website framework
                                            that I designed to the Laravel engine, quite a few changes had to be made to accomidate our website. Be that as it may, we fully understood that we 
                                            needed to maintain to idea of accepting changes in development and adapting to that change for the benefit of the project as well as the client, thus utilizing

                                            Although we all worked on individual tasks, we frequently offered each other assistence to better perform on our task. For example, 
                                            during the initial development of the <em>"Draft Website"</em>, my task was to create a skeleton framework both in html and css for use to utilize and contain
                                             our general content. However, I felt slightly guilty for picking such a simplistic task as Josh was assigned the task of finding a more professional 
                                             workflow to deploy the <em>"Draft Website"</em> on which seemed more demanding than it seemed. Therefore, once I completed my task (with a few minor fixes within the CSS) I 
                                             offered Josh a hand with finding an easy to use workflow, as well as offered to look over any ideas he had in case the workflow seemed too complex or had irrelavent 
                                             functions not otherwise suited for our product. This was made clear with all other aspects of the project, as we decided that although it would be nice 
                                             to utilize such things as Bootstrap or JQuery responsive tools for our project, the time frame just did not allow such luxuries, thereby standing with the agile principle

                                            <p>However, at times we did not always convey good team work, mainly towards seeking out assistence. This was made apparent muliple times within Sprint 2 (see Sprint 2 Retrospective within our repo)
                                             in which a majority of use did not ask for any assistence with roadblocks when we should have, rather than leaving the issue unresolved until the last minute. Other cases of this poped up once in a while
                                             during our other Sprints, however, mostly occured during the early stages of development. Furthermore, I found that too much time spent on helping one individual can greatly 
                                             affect the time frame given to you to be able to complete your own task. Essentially, I believe there were times we did not adhere to the agile principle 
                                             11. In this case, what we did to prevent any future cases that lacked team work after Sprint 2, was that each individual had to at least make an attempt to complete as much of
                                             a given task as possible by a given time frame, which we made it clear that Wednesdays and Thursdays was when we would show each other our work and finish up that task together.

                                        <p>As a functioning team, I believe that we had a good working relationship with one another,
                                            of which I was glad to be a part of. Even though there were some disagreements along the way, we encouraged each other
                                            to always perform to the best of our ability, especially when it came to high value tickets given to each other.
                                            I believe that I showed aspects of this attribute towards others, however, not so much to myself as I always doubted my own ability
                                            to complete a task or of the quality of the finished function. I wish to improve immensely on this in future as this type of mind set is 
                                            counter-productive to a working environment and causes more harm than good to the team as a whole. Therefore, in the future I plan on ensuring that I am of sound healthy
                                             condition that will allow my team members to find me reliabile enough to contribute and execute a task without allowing outside distractions or responsabilities
                                             to interfere with the project overall. During this process, I have learned and taken on board the fact that 
                                        no individual can successfully develop anything without consulting their team members for advice, assistence, or to simply confirm that your work is sufficient enough to be 
                                        intigrated into the project workflow. In addition, I've learned that no matter the circumstances an agile team must always follow the principle 12 without fail.

                                        <p>Overall as a team, I believe our time management frequently fluctuated during certain intervals but never to the extend that we 
                                            would snowball our project off course from the set schedule according to each Sprint's valocity. As stated before, in each Sprint when we were given our
                                         respective tasks, we would ensure that we would complete a majority of it or finish it by Tuesday to show the client what it is we are working on. This way 
                                        we can get sound advice from the client within the early stages of the development process, allowing us a good time frame to make any changes to the task to satisfy the 
                                    client's needs. Wednesdays and Thursdays were put aside to show each other our work and to fix any known bugs or errors within the software area that the task was made to do, 
                                thus we were able to utilize this set schedule efficiently and effectively when it matter the most. During this scheduling with our workload and with the client, we ensured to maintain the practise of

                                    As we had established what days were put aside for what (i.e. Tuesday: Client Day, Wednesday & Thursday: Final Editing/Debugging), I typically 
                                    used my mobile's Alarm tool to remind when to work on a task and when to take a break. While my main method for scheduling my tasks was by using my Laptops built-in calender and notification
                                     system. This is mainly because I am on my Laptop the most, ergo it made sense to apply this method to it. My mobile alarms were set for certain days and times, thus allowing me to maintain a good work schedule
                                      without <em>"burning out"</em>. I found these methods very helpful as well as efficient in splitting my workload into a nice set time frame that doesn't demand too much time or clash with other activities, 
                                      such as class.

                                      <p>Furthermore, my scheduling method allowed me to readjust any event that may not be relavent or no longer planed to occur. I also found it pretty useful
                                       to see when I needed to be prepared for the next Sprint Retrospective, of which I labeled it with its own icon to show its level of importance. In addition,
                                        I have these events emailed to my email address so I get a notification on my mobile just in case if Im not on or near my Laptop. I had also ensured that due to my part-time job occuring on weekends and half of Mondays,
                                         I am to not work on anything due to my tired state of mind. This is so I would produce working software more efficiently after some good sleep, as I have to get up at 5:30am on Monday to prepare for work which is not at all ideal to carry out project tasks with this sleep schedule.

                                        However, this did not take into account of any changes that would later on occur during our project, some of which could not be avoided
                                         or required our full attention to fix. Furthermore, this time management methodology I made really only applies to myself and would not always work 
                                         with the other team members' schedules, thus each person's individual method of time management would quite often clash with another's. The worst cases being
                                          that their attention would be on something else rather than their task and their schedule would cause them to be absent or only present for a very short period of time.
                                           Although we completly understood that each person had their own responsabilities outside of the project, this type of scheduling and time management did not work well with our group
                                            and would of course force those remaining to work around the issue or worse, have to pick up a person's task for them.

                                        In my opinion, our time management should have been a fixed method that we all used so we could mold it around everyone's own schedule, as not everyone could attend scrums or the scheduled 
                                         Thursday meetings. Would this have been put into place, I believe our Sprints would have had a 100% completion rate far more often and would not have one or two old tasks from a previous Sprint, 
                                         In addition to this, we could have followed through far more effectivly if we had utilized agile principle 3 our workload could have been managed better, 
                                         as well as allowed us some flexibility between Sprints. <blockquote cite="https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/">

                                            as well as modivate myself with a good method. The mothodology I used to modivate productivity within myself was the idea that should I fail to produce
                                             any work or complete my task insufficiently, then my team would then fail and as a result the work load would pile up overtime. By consistently enforcing negative reinforcement 
                                             upon myself, it allowed me to be fully invested into my set tasks with the idea of <em>"The Worst Possible Outcome"</em> in the back of my mind, telling myself
                                              that I must avoid that outcome no matter the circumstances. Whereas with modivating the team as a whole, I found that it was pretty simplistic to be modivated as we all knew each other
                                               on a personal level which allowed for a more laid back approach during the beinging of the project. It also helped with working together as we knew what each of us were capable of,  
                                                ergo allowing for good work ethic and low levels of stress. I believe our key method of motivation within our team was using humour and casual conversation to ease the mood in the work place, 
                                                for example, rather than give our team name something sensable or professional we named ourselves Team 🐈, which I personally found quite funny. It only added to the humour when the GitHUb website developers 
                                                saw that our cat emoji wasn't working with their framework and thus added in extra code that allowed emojis to display on the GitHub site.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            In terms of things that went wrong, I believe the only downside with modivation was that I contributted a lack of motivation towards other team members.
                                             This was due mainly to focusing solely on myself more often rather than encouraging others around me, which would then create a domino effect as respect and 
                                             encouragement works both ways. Therefore if one team member wasn't modivating themselves or others, then the rest would soon follow suit. Although this was usually a rare occurence 
                                             within our team dynamic, it still would have been more productive to utilize agile principle 5 as a project cannot be successfully produced with an unmodivated team.<blockquote cite="https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/">
                                                5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

                                        <p>
                                            I've learned from this experience that in order for tasks, as well as the project as a whole, to be successfully completed there must always be high levels
                                             of self-modivation and trust amoung team members. It is also important to recognize which scenareos are appropriate to have casual attitude, and when to behave on a professional level
                                              within the work place, thus avoiding the possibility of going off track from the task at hand. In future, I wish to be far more involved with others on their tasks and to maintain a healthy attitude
                                               in the work place environment so that I do not affect others negatively.

                                                <p>Learned about LAravel framework, and GitHub workflow. Believed it to be more essential to practise themselves
                                                    programmes and get into the habbit of using the MAMP interface to connect to our website. It was more important, in my opinion,
                                                     to learn and understand Github and Laravel rather than learn a new technology otherwise not required for the project as it would have
                                                     just cut into time that could be spent on this new technology/software.

                                        <p><b>Details:</b> Began our first official team meeting today, of which we had discussed which tasks had been completed and our mode of communication.
                                         We decided to create a Facebook chat group as opposed to more traditional methods of communication within a professional team-based environment,
                                         as this way we could maintain consistent contact with one another across multiple platforms (i.e. PC, mobile, iPad, etc) that would incorperate the use of Facebook.
                                         Further discussion involved my Deployment task, of which had been completed, as I had found a pre-built CSS framework that we could operate with and build our content upon.
                                         This is so we do not waste too much time stylising the framework and more time on organizing which sections will contain which content, such as whether or not we require a home page. 
                                        Our meeting closed on setting a collective goal of having something to display by tomorrow, both to the client as well as the team. </p><br>

                                        <p><b>Details:</b> We had gathered in-class as we were having our usual scrum meeting before we began on our work. I decided to share my findings
                                         on the pre-built CSS stylesheet that I searched up during the weekend. Although relativly simplistic, we found that this framework did not
                                         fit well with our current styling that we had currently set into place. This in turn had caused small levels of disappointment within myself, 
                                        as I felt as though I had failed the team and in turn wasted valuable time. However, they reinsured me by making slight modifications to the layout we have rather than try to bruteforce the CSS into our html.
                                     Due to this outcome, I have found that I need to be more organized with my set tasks, as well as to not do excessive work that may collide with the Project's scope. 
                                     Furthermore, I should instill trust within my skill level, as we decided to stick with the CSS skeleton that I created rather than attempt to make a new one.</p><br>
                                        <p><b>Goals Completed:</b> Pre-Built CSS & Testing (Conflicts)- Initially, this was to prevent any work around thus all styling would be completed, but as stated before, prooved to be a waste of valuable time.<br>

                                        In terms of our communication, we managed to pass on information in a timely mannor and was conveyed efficiently for each of us to easily understand. Our website came together quite well once we had sorted out the root folder,
                                         in which was quite disorganized before hand. We decided that in future we must have more frequent scrums with places and times set, this way we can attend them more frequently rather than asking if there is one on the day a scrum should take place.
                                          We did not communicate well with our client, which needs to happen more often to adapt our tasks to fit their needs. Furthermore, our team needs to clearly identify who is doing what at the beginning of the Sprint. We do expect the valocity of each Sprint to increase overtime, 
                                          as the workload will become more complex.

                                        <p><b>Details:</b> We came together during this retrospective to discuss mainly on the short comings we had as a team, as well as individuals. 
                                             For me, my completed clock task needed to be re-edited countless times as I had produced inapproriate code, disorganized flow of javascript,
                                              and just overall display did not meet professional criteria. The clock was modified to meet such criteria, but was discussed that I cannot produce something so low level 
                                              in which case I will better myself on in future tasks. We discussed that when it comes to our set tasks, we need to analyze what the user story is asking, think about how to carry it out,
                                               and each of us must have something to show each other during the next meeting. This is so we can think critically and approach the tasks as professionally as possible. 
                                            To encourage such a mind set, we established that each Tuesday will be set for displaying what we have so far to the client, while as Wednesdays and Thursday are to work on final debugging for each task. 
                                            We made this decission so that we can improve client-to-staff relationship as well as communication, plus it allows us to have a set timeframe to get things going.

                                        <p><b>Details:</b> We have begun incorperating our current website into the Laravel workflow, in which all team members are working on. 
                                        I have discussed with the team about how the countdown clock is being displayed, and have decided upon displaying it in just simple text rather than 
                                    have it sit inside a block with green background. The background was removed as the styling of it clashed with not only our workflow, but the Laravel framework as well. 
                                I have aslo made some adjustments to the CSS stylesheet, so that the layout engineer can easily manage it without any roadblocks. Furthermore, I had consulted with the team about our CSS and Javascript situation
                             and had said that rather than have inline styling within the html, we should instead place the CSS and Javascript within seperate files and link them on their respective pages. This was done so that the elegance and integerity of the code would be layed out in a professional
                             mannor and would avoid any styling and code clashes. Additionally, this was due to the fact that some of the CSS and JAvascript had similar tag lines and could cause errors should the framework confuse which tags belong to which function or style. Plus it is good programming edicate,
                             and is aestheticly pleasing to work with tidy code.</p><br>
